The Distributed Telemetry and Advanced Control (DTAC) framework is a collection of projects designed to reduce the time
to completion of software projects and testbeds by providing a highly reusable and extensible framework for the
collection of monitoring and manipulation of a wide variety of systems. 

This project, the DTAC Agent, is focused on the endpoints. It is designed to run on various operating systems including
Windows, Linux and MacOS (Darwin). It provides access to a wide variety of telemetry on these systems and also provides
the ability to control many of the system parameters out of the box. It has been designed to be highly extensible 
through a multitude of methodologies described in more detail in the [extensibility](#extensibility) section below.
