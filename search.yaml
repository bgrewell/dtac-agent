# The purpose of the search.yaml file is to assist with finding relevant projects and code.
# This is designed to showcase how using a simple form like this could free projects from
# the unnecessary complexity of having a hierarchy where they must fit into specific bins
# which has the downside of being highly subjective for both the person placing the project
# and the person searching for a project. Many projects also have a handful of places they
# could fit. This approach would make hierarchy irrelevant and allow simple searching based
# on the tags and labels sections. It's flexible enough that authors can mix and match as
# needed and allows very natural searching.
#
# For example all of these searches would find this project
# search: dtac-agent
# search: windows telemetry
# search: extensible linux control
# search: extensible rest api
# search: go rest api
#
# Labels could be made mandatory to aid in search such as active and state. Then you could
# add to your search like active=true !state=beta

description: The distributed telemetry and advanced control agent is a system service designed to run on a multitude of
  operating systems including Windows, Linux and MacOS. It provides a wide range of system telemetry and control 
  functions out of the box and is highly extensible through plugins and compiled in modules. All of these telemetry and
  control functions are exposed through a rich flexible REST API.
